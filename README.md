<h2>What is this project?</h2>
<p>
This project was developed over the course of Summer 2019 as a personal project to extend beyond what I had learnt during the course of my A-Levels. Project cogless is an early prototype of a 2D Platformer game with level creation similar to that of Mario Maker. My aims with this project were to create a simple 2D game engine using Java. Even though I never completed this project I achieved my goals with the project.
